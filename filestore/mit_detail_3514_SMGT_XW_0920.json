            "desc": "Explore how new and existing business strategies can be improved through the rebalancing of three key relationships: Minds and Machines, Products and Platforms, and the Core and the Crowd.In recent years, innovative businesses have used a range of novel digital tools, from apps to AI, to invent new business models and delight customers with convenience, high quality, and low prices. This wave of technology fueled disruption has already transformed many industries, and it\u2019s just getting started. This executive program explores how new and existing business strategies can be improved through the introduction of technologies and digital systems. The framework of the course is based on the book Machine, Platform, Crowd: Harnessing Our Digital Future written by MIT Sloan faculty and New York Times best selling authors Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee. This places the program in a unique position to leverage the knowledge and experience of these experts and guide you towards the creation of innovative business strategies.This 6-week course will guide you through an exploration of the principles that underpin Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee\u2019s book, research, and teaching. It frames this particular approach to business strategy as an attempt to find a balance between methods that have been used traditionally and new ways in which companies can use technology to improve their best-practices.The main focus of this executive program is the rebalancing of three key relationships: human minds and machines; physical products and digital platforms; and the core (centralized knowledge) and the crowd (decentralized knowledge). You\u2019ll be introduced to examples of companies that have excelled at finding a harmony between tradition and technology. Furthermore, you\u2019ll be supported in uncovering ways to relate these principles to your organization through weekly, ongoing project submissions which encourage you to apply concepts to a business scenario.\"People are racing against the machine, and many of them are losing that race\u2026 Instead of racing against the machine, we need to learn to race with the machine. That is our grand challenge.\" \u2013 Erik Brynjolfsson, Director of the Initiative on the Digital Economy",

            "desc": "Management literature is overflowing with advice on becoming the boss. Yet as executives ascend closer to the top slots, the paths to the C-suite narrows. Those who are successful are often highly strategic in how they navigate their careers. This new program will help you better understand and communicate the value you will bring to the C-suite and provide you with a practical framework for charting your own course to the top.Executives looking for opportunities to lead at the highest levels often wonder, what do I need to do to reach the C-suite? While reaching the top rungs requires many of the same leadership skills and perspectives as decades prior, organizations today are also searching for seasoned executives who possess a new type of mindset. C-level leadership today must be able to help companies pivot quickly if needed, fend off insurgent competitors, and have an intense customer focus. They must also be willing to self-correct and adapt to new leadership norms. For this reason, many companies are eager for executives who think like entrepreneurs.Strategies for Career Development is designed to help you better understand what strengths you will bring to the C-suite as well as provide you with a proven framework for finding your own path to the top. Because while you can\u2019t possess every leadership capability, or foresee every shift in the external environment, you can carefully steer your own career and professional development.The career development course is taught by Cassandra Frangos, Ed.D., an expert adviser and coach on leadership and organizational transformation and author of Crack the C-Suite Code: How Successful Leaders Make it to the Top and Roberto Fernandez, MIT Sloan Professor of Organizational Studies. Together they will present findings from their latest research and lead discussions on the changing C-suite landscape, navigating bias and breaking through the glass ceiling, and the current trends in executive search.Program content will also include:Many of the research-driven takeaways from this program are equally valuable to HR professionals and human capital decision makers, including:As a participant in this course you will also take advantage of the 360\u00b0 feedback receiving insight into your strengths and areas for development in order to help you reach your next career step.",

According to research by Hal Gregersen, co-author of The Innovator's DNA and executive director of the MIT Leadership Center, mastering five key skills forms the foundation for finding ideas that create value. This innovation program helps executives learn to achieve breakthrough insights through self-assessment, catalytic questioning, deep observation, diverse networking, and rapid experimentation.Every great innovator, from Jeff Bezos to Steve Jobs, excels at asking the right questions. Day-in and day-out they seek provocative new insights by getting out of their offices and into the real world, actively observing, networking, and experimenting to generate valuable new ideas. By doing so, they improve our lives and grow our economy, finding new solutions to the most challenging problems we face. Innovative entrepreneurs and intrapreneurs act differently to think differently and, in the end, they make a significant impact..Building on hundreds of interviews and more than ten thousand survey assessments, Gregersen delivers unique insight into the behaviors of extraordinary innovators. Participants of this new program will learn and practice important discovery skills that lead to new and disruptive innovation, ranging from product improvement to new market creation, to generate valuable, new economic growth.These key innovation skills include:\u2022    Questioning the status quo\n\u2022    Observing the world like anthropologists\n\u2022    Networking with diverse people to get new ideas\n\u2022    Experimenting in small, fast, and cheap ways to reach novel solutions\n\u2022    Connecting typically unconnected insights to deliver disruptive new business ideasTo put this innovation strategy into practice, participants will identify an individual challenge for which they seek a solution and commit to innovating around that challenge throughout the two days. They will also engage in a personal diagnostic assessment to better understand their own innovation and execution focused leadership skills.You will receive a certificate of course completion at the conclusion of this course.

            "desc": "This project management training program enables participants to reduce the complexity involved in large projects by restructuring development and management procedures in ways that produces small-team results. MIT\u2019s innovative solution, based on the design structure matrix (DSM), is devised to streamline complex projects by developing detailed models to understand the intricate interactions and iterative nature of design. The program also discusses modern agile development methods and their application in complex technical projects.Managing complex technical projects is a massive effort well beyond the scope of a simple project plan. Complex systems are comprised of hundreds or thousands of interconnected components, each potentially developed by a different group of people distributed over multiple organizations. Cost and schedule overruns are common. How can technical program leaders better manage such a complex process?This 3-day online program offers two specific sets of techniques which technical managers can use to better handle the complexity of large product and service development efforts. Two days of the course focus on the design structure matrix (DSM) method, while the third day teaches modern agile development methods.DSM techniques have been used by MIT researchers to study complex system development and to help technical managers improve project performance. After field-testing DSM in dozens of organizations and industries around the world, the method is now being applied in a wide range of technical industries \u2013 automotive, software, aerospace, telecommunications, medical devices, energy systems, electronics, capital equipment, large-scale construction, and more.Agile development techniques have been evolving in the software industry for many years. Today we are finding ways to apply agile methods in many other types of technical projects. However, some of the techniques that work for software projects are difficult to apply in other realms. The key to application of agile methods is to understand which of the many tools to use in any particular project.",

This highly interactive problem solving course focuses on advanced leadership skills for holding and managing multiple perspectives simultaneously to leverage and unleash the creative potential of divergence in and across business to generate richer outcomes.In the context of great change and uncertainty, we must show up differently as leaders. We must be great problem solvers. Creativity is a necessity. We have to put ourselves in a position of constant learning. And we must be able to change and flex our point of view: not necessarily the way we see the world, but certainly the way we see ourselves.This problem solving course is taught by Aithan Shapira, an internationally acclaimed artist and MIT Sloan lecturer, and Wanda Orlikowski, Professor of Information Technologies and Organization Studies at MIT Sloan, Unlocking the Power of Perspectives is an immersive learning experience with the potential to substantially alter how you lead, listen, collaborate, negotiate, and connect with others.This critical thinking and problem solving course is highly interactive\u2014be prepared to participate and engage. You will work individually and in groups to better understand the value of different perspectives and how to incorporate those perspectives into your management and leadership styles. As you build rapport with your peers, you\u2019ll complete challenges related to the tension of holding conflicting perspectives, starting at different reference points, and tracking and learning from healthy differentiation. Stepping outside the conventional business context, you will take inspiration from the work of jazz musicians to understand how to organize, communicate, and connect with others while engaging in change.Faculty will share examples of highly successful leaders who changed and evolved their own leadership styles to enable their companies to survive disruption and thrive. You\u2019ll learn how executives have transformed company culture and increased revenue simply by changing the way they listen and solve problems.The course also covers skills for visualizing and working in opposing perspectives. You will learn visual thinking strategies that can help you elicit and harness perspectives in ways that cultivate adaptability, creativity, and innovation. Because the better you are at shifting your mindset and approach and concentrating on relationships in the moment \u2014 without losing sight of your motivation \u2014 the more likely you are to steer your team toward success.You will receive a certificate of course completion at the conclusion of this course.

            "desc": "This executive business course introduces participants to the concept of \u201ccommonality\" or product platforms\u2014the sharing of components, processes, technologies, interfaces and/or infrastructure across a product family. Successful product platform management software allows companies to develop better products more easily, improve product family planning and lifecycle management, and increase corporate profitability. Learn how you can develop a strong platform strategy that will deliver ROI for your organization.Companies from Lockheed Martin to GE use product platform strategies to deliver more variety to their customers and compete more effectively. For example, Black and Decker uses shared motors and batteries across a range of power tools. These firms realize quicker new market entry and reduced costs but, in order to do so, they must orchestrate complex, multi-product development projects.However, recent research suggests that many firms fail to earn a return on their platform investments. This work has uncovered that many firms face systemic pressure to diverge from their platform sharing. Several cases studied realized less than half of their platform sharing goals. Are these failures the result of a flawed product platform management strategy or poor execution?This executive business course focuses on helping companies develop strong platform strategies and execution programs by teaching executives how to understand the managerial levers necessary to operate in complex environments. As a participant in this course, you\u2019ll be exposed to a range of strategies, from product platform, to supply chain platform, to industry platforms. The executive business course content draws on case examples from a diversity of industries and includes opportunities for you and your peers to share and discuss industry experience.As part of the live online session, you will also be offered the opportunity to schedule a private 15-minute consulting session with faculty member Bruce Cameron to discuss any individual issues or concerns facing your organization.You will receive a certificate of course completion at the conclusion of this course. You may also be interested in our Executive Certificates which are designed around a central themed track and consist of several courses. Learn more.",

This new program explores a number of strategies used to attract and retain top talent and illustrates how these strategies are being designed and used at cutting-edge companies.While people have always been critical to the success of organizations, many business leaders still make key decisions about their workforce based on intuition, experience, advice, and guesswork. However, today\u2019s leaders can improve their people decision-making based on the collection and systematic analysis of data.Leading People at Work: Strategies for Talent Analytics focuses on the strategies that can be used to successfully design and implement people analytics in an organization. Faculty draw on the latest practices and research to illustrate how leading companies are using cutting-edge techniques to analyze data about their employees to and make their organizations and their individual employees more successful. In doing so, we will explore areas where talent analytics are most effective, and where it is particularly important to incorporate them. Participants of this program will gain a deeper understanding of how and when people analytics can be applied to improve critical issues such as recruiting and hiring, performance evaluation, promotion and training, compensation, and organizational change.The program takes the perspective of the general manager when examining how emerging big data analytical approaches applied to human resource management can be used to advance business objectives.

When challenges persist, it is often because there are embedded tensions or paradoxes that surface and seem unresolvable. This research-driven and practitioner-led program is designed to help senior executives avert failure, create cultures of agility and resiliency, and develop a customized blueprint for large-scale business transformation in their organization.We know through research and practice that two thirds of enterprise-wide transformation efforts fail to meet their intended objectives. Why? In today\u2019s world, disruption can emerge from any place, any time and in ways unexpected. Leaders often ignore or miss the early warning signals, due to a variety of factors, including cultural inertia, lack of disciplined scanning and decision making processes, and siloed behavior that tends to discount troubling signs that impact other parts of the organization. When unit leaders turn inward to protect their entities, organizational agility becomes that much harder to achieve.But effective leaders and their teams can beat the odds that their organizations\u2019 transformation efforts will fail. How? They set proactive agendas that create an inspiring future for employees. They build trust-based cultures of openness and transparency, combined with the discipline to spot and solve significant problems collectively as a team. They align the \u201cmessaging\u201d of their agendas with the metrics, milestones, and rewards that provide a clear line-of-sight for employees to understand how they can contribute and what behaviors are valued in their organizations.During this two-day program, you will learn organizational transformation strategies and how to spot potential derailers that prevent successful transformations; more importantly, you\u2019ll learn how to become a successful transformation leader in your organization. Research based and practitioner led, the program environment is designed to help executives create a blueprint for their organization\u2019s near- and longer-term transformation. Guest speakers will help to further demonstrate important conceptual examples, and significant time will be designated for peer collaboration and plan development.",

But it does not happen in a vacuum. Innovation requires connections, just as entrepreneurship does, among key stakeholders\u2014entrepreneurs, universities, risk capital providers, government, and large corporations. These connections are increasingly taking place in \u201cinnovation ecosystems\u201d and through programs such as accelerators, hackathons, prize competitions, and co-working spaces in which stakeholders and communities contribute and share resources (e.g., talent, ideas, infrastructure, money, and connections).How can leaders harness the power of these open innovation ecosystems around the globe or in a specific region of interest for their organizations?

However, cybersecurity issues are not purely a technology problem\u2014they are multi-headed hydras that need to be addressed with a multi-disciplinary approach. This cybersecurity course is not intended to provide guidance on IT infrastructure or troubleshooting, rather it focuses on the humanistic and managerial aspects of cybersecurity. As a participant in this cyber security training for executives course, you will be provided with a framework of managerial protocols to follow, resulting in a personalized playbook with actionable next steps towards creating a more cyber-aware culture within your organization.On the surface, a ransomware attack that effectively locks up your organization\u2019s data is a technical one: Can the data be unlocked, and how fast? But embedded within cyber risk and cybersecurity are a host of management problems as well, including decisions about whether to pay the ransom, how your organization should operate if its data remains locked, how to talk to the media, and whether new policies are required to respond to similar issues in the future.In today\u2019s landscape of escalating cybercrime, mitigating cyber risk is not the Chief Information Security Officer\u2019s responsibility alone\u2014it is everyone\u2019s job. Getting ahead of hackers and other security risks requires the active engagement of non-technical management, as well as an overall commitment to building a cybersecurity culture within your enterprise.Cybersecurity Leadership for Non-Technical Executives provides leaders and managers with frameworks and best practices for managing cybersecurity-related risk separate from the specialized IT infrastructure typically associated with this topic. Course content includes lectures, highly interactive discussions, and case studies related to:Key concepts from the various learning modules are cumulatively combined into a personalized action plan \u2013 a playbook \u2013 of what to do next and how to manage various stakeholders throughout your organization. This will also enable you to have more informed conversations with your CISO or other technology leaders regarding cyberthreat management.The cybersecurity course also draws from the U.S. Commerce Department\u2019s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Framework for policy and management planning\u2014a flexible and cost-effective approach to protecting critical infrastructure.You will receive a certificate of course completion at the conclusion of this course.

Research topics range from the governance of the internet to global trade policies for cyber-risky internet-enabled devices to new approaches for calculating the costs and benefits of cybersecurity investments. MIT\u2019s ability to bring world-class technology and engineering resources to address managerial problems is unparalleled, and cybersecurity is precisely the type of escalating issue that MIT exists to overcome.\n ",
        "who_attend_desc": "The intended audience for this program includes general managers, executives, and VP\u2019s looking to learn managerial skills and strategy related to cybersecurity awareness and mitigating the risk of cyber attacks. This cybersecurity course is not for technical executives and senior security leaders (CISOs).Why is this course is designed for general managers and not for security leaders?\nGeneral managers need to be knowledgeable participants in cybersecurity discussions and activities. Cybersecurity decisions made by the security teams can have direct impact on business opportunities and processes. Without an understanding of the elements of cybersecurity, a general manager risks his or her business. Decisions made about cybersecurity can impact options available to the general manager, and no one wants their business options limited because of security decisions made without them. Further, because keeping data and systems secure is in everyone\u2019s best interest, it\u2019s critical for general managers to know the language and the basic cybersecurity frameworks to inform their decisions.We do not recommend this program to past participants of Cybersecurity for Managers: A Playbook unless you are looking for a refresher.",

Winner of the student-nominated 2019 Digital Technology Award for effectively using digital technology to improve teaching at MIT, Curhan makes use of the latest technology in this program, too. You can expect simulations and experiences with artificial intelligence (AI).AI as a Teacher: One of the highlights of this program is the use of iMotions Affectiva, which is an expression analysis technology from MIT\u2019s Media Lab. It recognizes emotion based on facial cues or physiological responses. During a live negotiation, the technology will map your face. Then, it will produce a report indicating how many times your face displayed different affect states. You will then reflect on how your facial expressions influence your ability to get across your message and what you might change. ",

This highly interactive course helps executives cultivate deeply inquisitive leadership practices that can lead to breakthrough results and improved problem-solving techniques. Bring a real challenge to workshop and leave with research-based insights and methods for transforming yourself, your teams, and your organization into being more curious, fearless, and innovative.Talk to the world\u2019s most creative problem-solvers and they will often tell you that asking the right questions led them to discover their most valuable innovations and continues to fuel positive change in their companies today.\n\nTake the social entrepreneur who created GoldieBlox, Debbie Sterling, who wondered, \u201cWhy are all the great building toys made for boys?\u201d Or, consider Nobel laureate Richard Thaler, who questioned, \u201cWould it change economic theory if we stopped pretending people were rational?\u201d Marc Benioff launched Salesforce with a query, \u201cWhy are we still loading and upgrading software when we have the internet?\u201d that created cloud-based software services. And Rod Drury, founder of Xero, routinely asks, \u201cWhat is the exact opposite of what an incumbent would expect us to do?\u201d to challenge the industry.\n\nGreat questions like these have a catalytic quality\u2014that is, they dissolve barriers to creative thinking and channel the pursuit of solutions into new, accelerated pathways. Asking such questions is essential in today\u2019s world where globalization, digitization, and disruption push leaders to the edge of uncertainty and force them to figure out what they don\u2019t know they don\u2019t know \u2013 before it\u2019s too late. Decades ago Peter Drucker grasped this truth when wisely warning that the \u201cimportant and difficult job is never to find the right answers, it is to find the right question. For there are few things as useless, if not dangerous, as the right answer to the wrong question.\u201d This is especially true in our times of radical transformation.\n\nIn this live online program, Hal Gregersen and Roger Lehman deliver unique insights into the behaviors of extraordinary leaders and the unique conditions they created at work and in life to ask catalytic, game-changing questions. Course discussions and practical applications draw on interviews with several hundred business leaders during the past decade, including research studies conducted specifically for Gregersen\u2019s newest book, Questions Are the Answer: A Breakthrough Approach to Your Most Vexing Problems at Work and in Life.\n\nThrough engaging discussion and active challenge-driven exercises, you will learn conceptual frameworks and behavioral habits for cultivating an inquiry-driven approach to leadership and life. These same methodologies will also help you overcome the natural challenges of isolation as a senior leader and help you uncover your greatest blindspots\u2014what you don\u2019t know you don\u2019t know. Drawing from the successful approaches of companies like Amazon, ASOS, Patagonia, Pixar, and Zappos, you will learn how to create the special conditions for curiosity, inquiry, and \u201ccreative friction\u201d to thrive and to fuel productive change in your organization. Come ready to make progress on a real challenge you face and leave prepared to lay the foundation for truly catalytic questions to fuel greater success at work, and perhaps in life.This new, highly interactive program helps executives cultivate deeply inquisitive leadership practices that can lead to breakthrough results.You will receive a certificate of course completion at the conclusion of this course.

The challenge is that interpreting data from multiple sources isn\u2019t common knowledge for most business professionals. How do we know which algorithm to use? How do we know when to apply your human judgement into the decision mix? What are some of the most practical applications of artificial intelligence?Business analytics skills are a requirement across a variety of job functions and are in high demand from employers. In fact, job postings for this skill set has increased by 130 per-cent from September 2016 to the present. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) expects growth for business analytics skills to jump 10.9 percent, outpacing the national growth average of 5.2 percent for all jobs, from 2018 to 2028.In the non-technical Applied Business Analytics program, you will learn a practical framework that will enable you to use data to improve decision-making.

Predictions are numerical.\nExample: Learn how a linear regression algorithm can change outcomes for a professional sports teamLogistic Regression\nThe adaptation of Linear regression to problems of classification (e.g., Yes/No questions,groups,etc.)\nExample: Use logistic regression to predict coronary heart diseaseDecision Tree\nA graph that uses a brannching method to match all possible outcomes of a decision.\nExample: Using a cutting-edge algorithm called an optimal classification tree, we will establish optimal inventory positions for smart phones.Random Forest\nTakes the average of many decision trees, each of which is made with a sample of the data. Each tree is weaker than a full decision tree, but by combining them we get better overall performance.\nExample: Predict Supreme Court decisions using random forestClustering\nSees what groups the data points fall into when we apply a clustering algorithm, such as K-Means\nExample: Use hierarchical clustering to group movie genres for NetflixAI/Deep learning\nAllows machines to solve complex problems by learning from large amounts of data, algorithms inspired by the human brain.\nExample: Train a computer to read numbers.

How should I price this service?  How do I use the budget process to help me plan better in the first place?  How do I evaluate the performance of my employees?

Are you prepared to assess market opportunities? Will customers readily understand the value of your innovation? This program is designed to provide executives who already have deep technical or functional experience with a thorough review of key marketing concepts as they relate to new innovations and new products. This course also covers new digital techniques and the evolution of marketing as a data-driven science.Even the most brilliant innovation can fail if you don\u2019t know how to market it. In other words, just because you build it doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll come. Marketing Innovation helps participants leverage marketing concepts and research to better influence the outcomes of new products and innovations. Participants learn how to evaluate market attractiveness, think about the design and management of distribution channels, and understand pricing architectures.The first day of the course provides a strategic and practical approach to understanding consumer decision making, analyzing company strengths, and assessing the competition. This strategic approach is applied to real world examples to help technical executives learn to identify the right product for the right market opportunity. On the second day, the course turns to practical issues, including pricing architectures, building channel relationships and marketing communications decisions. Participants will learn the pros and cons of digital marketing and explore how to leverage new digital techniques to optimize marketing outcomes.After completing the two-day program, participants will have learned a common language that they can use to interact more effectively with the marketing and strategy professionals in their own firms.You will receive a certificate of course completion at the conclusion of this course.

            "desc": "Over the past two decades, some of the most profitable and successful firms are those that have adopted a digital platform model\u2014a platform strategy whereby the company allows two or more disparate groups to interact over a platform to co-create value; for example, website developers and users on Akamai, recruiters and employees on LinkedIn, and drivers and customers on Uber. In this two-day program, participants eager to develop or launch a digital platform approach will learn why and how their business strategies may need to be revised to be successful.In 2018, eight of the top ten global brands (according to Brandz) were platform-orientated companies \u2014companies that created and now dominate arenas in which buyers, sellers, and a variety of third parties are connected in real time. In today\u2019s networked age, the cloud, social media, and mobile devices are fueling this platform competition, and more and more companies want in. However, many companies do not succeed in becoming platform leaders because their technology and/or business strategies fall short.While many platform strategies are well known (e.g. Apple\u2019s iTunes), there are other less-heralded platforms that are exploring new ways to create and capture value. These include: dynamic pricing, usage fees, highly targeted product and service offerings, inbound marketing, and network effects.Key questions the faculty explores in this platform business model course include:Through case studies and Q&A, experienced managers will emerge with insights into how they can refresh their company\u2019s strategic approach and participate profitably in the multi-sided marketplaces of the future.This unique program now runs over the course of three weeks, allowing participants more time to digest content. Through case studies and an ongoing faculty-directed mini project, experienced managers will emerge with robust insights into how they can refresh their company\u2019s strategic approach and participate profitably in the multi-sided marketplaces of the future. The last day of program will be dedicated to an in-depth Q&A session and team specific feedback with faculty.You will receive a certificate of course completion at the conclusion of this course.

            "desc": "The landscape for leadership has changed. Increasingly, leaders are accountable for the economic and social welfare of the entire enterprise while simultaneously running a business, project, function, or geography. We refer to this role as an enterprise leader. If you are such a leader and/or if you oversee a team of such leaders, this executive training course is intended to help you sharpen mindsets and provide skillsets required to shepherd your entire organization toward greater agility and growth. It is also designed to help you create a culture in which leaders are held accountable for having an enterprise perspective.For the past couple of decades, companies have focused on creating strong leaders of business units and influential heads of functions who are responsible for achieving results in one corner of an organization. But many of these same companies have underemphasized a more important challenge: developing leaders who see the enterprise as a whole and act for its greater good. That perspective has become increasingly necessary as companies seek to provide not just products, but the broad-based, integrated solutions customers now demand.Led by and based on the research of MIT Sloan Senior Lecturer Douglas Ready, an expert on organizational transformation and the role of senior executive teams in driving change, Building Great Teams (formerly titled Leading Enterprise Teams) is designed to help senior executives think differently and gain an enterprise mindset about what constitutes effective leadership in this ever-evolving environment. If you serve on or oversee an enterprise-level team, or if you are responsible for hiring and developing such teams, this executive enterprise leadership training course is for you.Through lectures, case studies, and highly interactive discussions, you will be presented with the key mindsets and skillsets necessary to lead with an enterprise mindset. Course content will address many of the leadership challenges you face including:The program will also feature an Executive Perspective to embed the enterprise leadership concepts in a real-life context.You will receive a certificate of course completion at the conclusion of this course.

Though few in overall number, they exist in manufacturing, high tech, heavy industry, product design and production, and services, such as health care delivery.

Each module consists of several sessions, which demonstrate, first, the positive impact through successful application of those key principles, and then provides examples of negative results when those principles were clearly needed but not applied.

Please register on the Emeritus website.Design thinking is a powerful approach to new product development that begins with understanding unmet customer needs. It\u2019s a human-centered design process that approaches problem-solving with understanding the user needs. Design thinking encompasses concept development, applied creativity, prototyping, and experimentation. When design thinking approaches are applied to business, the success rate for innovation has been seen to improve substantially.Design-driven companies such as Apple, Coca-Cola, IBM, Nike, Procter & Gamble, and Whirlpool have outperformed the S&P 500 over the past 10 years by an accumulated 211% in what's called the Design Value Index\u2014a portfolio of 16 publicly traded companies that integrate design thinking into corporate strategy. According to a 2016 report from the Design Management Institute, this marks the third consecutive year the index has shown an excess of 200% over the S&P 500.The Mastering Design Thinking program will lead participants through a step by step, design thinking process. To be considered successful, innovations have to solve the three key dimensions of Desirability, Feasibility, and Viability.Desirability: Is this product or service addressing a real customer need?\nFeasibility: Can we develop a solution that is technically feasible and better than competitors?\nViability: Is there a viable business model around this product or service?Learn more about Emeritus technical requirements.",

We negotiate all the time\u2014with clients and partners, vendors and suppliers, supervisors and colleagues, employees and recruits. Drawing on fundamental negotiation principles, groundbreaking scientific research, and specific real-world examples, this program will help you enhance personal gains in negotiation, while simultaneously sustaining these important relationships.Successful negotiation requires self-awareness, preparation, and practice. This negotiation training course addresses all three requirements by providing extensive personalized feedback, tips for efficient pre-negotiation planning, and many opportunities to practice and hone your negotiation skills.In Negotiation for Executives, Professor Jared Curhan presents a comprehensive framework to facilitate efficient and effective negotiation preparation, including scientifically validated survey measures that provide insight into your personality and approach to negotiation. This research-based framework helps negotiators analyze and better understand negotiation situations through perspective-taking, benchmarking, creative problem-solving, and brainstorming.Course material is presented in a series of lectures, discussions, and engaging exercises that provide extensive personalized feedback and are designed to help you leverage your individual traits to achieve success and build lasting relationships at the bargaining table. Numerous negotiation simulations will help you practice and hone your new negotiation skills. The simulations are followed up with lively, interactive discussions in which Professor Curhan relates simulation experiences to scientific theory and research.True to the deeply analytical and quantitative MIT style, the material in this program is based on extensive scientific research by Professor Curhan and his colleagues. Curhan is renowned not only for his engaging and interactive teaching style, but also for his pioneering research on the social and psychological components of negotiation. His research includes topics such as: conceptions of fairness, concern for personal integrity, lasting reputations, company loyalty, preference change during the course of a negotiation, norms for appropriate negotiating behavior, and relational dynamics among negotiators who interact multiple times.Please note: There is approximately 45 minutes of pre-work including an assignment that should be completed prior to the start of class. It\u2019s important to have this work completed thoughtfully with ample time before class, otherwise you may not be able to participate in the negotiation simulations and you also risk negatively impacting the learning experience for the fellow participant with whom you\u2019ll be partnered.",

            "desc": "Communicating and persuading effectively with data is a crucial skill for anyone who wants to lead in a modern organization. If presenting and explaining data to a non-technical audience is part of your job, this data storytelling course is for you. Highly practical and collaborative, this course combines visualization and strategic communication best practices to help you communicate data more effectively and influence others to take action based on data through data storytelling.This interactive course will give you the opportunity to improve your communication skills through practice and detailed feedback from the instructor and your classmates. You will have the opportunity to use that feedback to improve a current slide or presentation you are working on.By the end of this class, you will emerge with impactful materials, useful frameworks, and an improved ability to persuade others with data through data storytelling.No matter how good machines and algorithms get, leaders will still need the ability to influence and persuade others to make the best possible decisions based on the technology and data at hand. Whether your job requires you to communicate with leaders, colleagues, clients, or customers, you need to simplify and clarify your findings for your audience in order to persuade with data.This course is taught by Miro Kazakoff, a Senior Lecturer at MIT Sloan, entrepreneur, and consultant focused on how individuals use data to persuade others. As a participant in this interactive course, you will learn professional and practical skills required to develop, design, and deliver high-quality, logical communications grounded in quantitative data. You will learn how to craft clear and powerful narratives to guide audiences through your data and understand why the insights are important. You will also explore ways in which visual tools such as graphs, charts, and diagrams can be used in data storytelling to highlight your insights in a way that spreadsheets and dashboards cannot. You will leave this course a better data storyteller than you came.This is not a course about analytics tools; it is focused on communication skills. You will need access to a form of slide presentation software (e.g., PowerPoint, KeyNote, or Google) and a tool for visualizing data (Excel, Tableau, etc.). Come with a graph you can edit and improve.",

It provides key insights on how to retain technical staff, integrate technical professionals into the organization, build more successful project teams, and keep teams high-performing over time.Technical professionals' goals and incentives are often different from those of other employees, and so are the management challenges that arise. Drawing on the wealth of research and industry experience of faculty and leading practitioners, Managing Technical Professionals and Organizations explores proven, practical, and innovative strategies for maximizing the contribution of technical professionals. This intensive program focuses on the management and motivation of technical professionals in the innovative organization, and in particular:The Learning Experience\nOrganizations that are designed and managed for doing the same things well repetitively, as in manufacturing and operations, are not particularly appropriate for doing something well once, as in R&D. Running a technical organization presents a unique set of management problems. How do you motivate and reward technical professionals to maximize their performance and creativity? How do you create an organizational structure that will contribute to success, not inhibit it? How do you deal with creative individual contributors, project teams, and innovative professionals? How do you build and sustain high motivation and vitality while preventing complacency? How do you utilize \"marshaling\" events for building more collaborative, innovative activities? And how do you move information and technology effectively across organizational structures?This unique two-day program focuses on issues critical to the effective management of technical professionals and cross-functional teams. Its principles and strategies can be applied in any organization where research, development, engineering, or computer-related technology developments need to take place in a timely, effective, and successful manner.",

But what do you do when you have an existing product in an existing market that is being challenged? How do you revive those products and restart growth? This new program is designed to help you innovate around your existing products to make them more compelling, useful, and valuable.Please note: The application deadline for this market innovations course is 8 business days prior to course start.How do you innovate and improve existing products or services? If all you create is incremental improvements, you\u2019ll quickly become a low-cost (and vulnerable) commodity provider. But revolutionary, disruptive innovation is often expensive, difficult, and prone to failure.This innovation strategies program focuses on a third type of innovation that is neither incremental nor disruptive. It\u2019s an approach that many successful companies such as USAA, Sherwin-Williams, LEGO, Victoria\u2019s Secret, Novo Nordisk, Gatorade, and Logitech have used in mature markets to revive challenged products and boost growth. This low-risk, high-reward strategy is an approach to innovation that all company leaders should understand so that they can recognize it when their competitors practice it and apply it when it will give them a competitive advantage. The program combines this \u201cThird Way\u201d innovation framework with Sloan\u2019s Three Perspectives on Organizational Change framework to generate implementation plans for the solutions you create.Through lectures, case studies, hands-on activities, and conversations with senior practitioners, you\u2019ll learn a set of tried-and-true tools and techniques for generating creative solutions to organizational challenges. Our digital delivery over 3 days will also include the opportunity for you to apply new frameworks immediately to your own products/services \u2013 to generate immediate results for your business.This program is designed for executives and senior managers with leadership responsibility as well as teams.Learn more about the live online experience.",

The role of a leader is to identify the uncertainty that surrounds change and create the context for talking about and managing it. Disruptive change\u2014events that challenge our lives, organizations, industries, and societies in fundamental ways\u2014raises the stakes on all the above. How we navigate the transitions that result from disruption has a direct impact on outcomes.Led by Hal Gregersen and Roger Lehman, this innovative new change management training, conducted live online, takes a deep dive into the social and psychological journey that accompanies transition. You will explore and apply key concepts and tools to guide yourself and others successfully through the behavioral, cognitive, and emotional arcs of individual and team transitions\u2014the Transition-Curve Framework. By understanding how people move through these three arcs at their own pace, you will be better equipped to build organizational support for yourself and high-performing teams before, during, and after transitions. And you will be able to avoid common leadership mistakes that over-emphasize performance and de-emphasize the human side of transitions.This course will include customized graphic illustrations to serve as a dynamic tool for reflection and application.

Through exercises and simulation models participants experience the long-term side effects and impacts of decisions and understand the ways in which performance is tied to structures and policies.Systems thinking was devised to improve people's ability to manage organizations comprehensively in a volatile global environment. It offers managers a framework for understanding complex situations and the dynamics those situations produce. Systems thinking\u009d is a response to the rapid changes in technology, population, and economic activity that are transforming the world, and as a way to deal with the ever-increasing complexity of today's business.Senior managers can use the system dynamics method to design policies that lead their organizations to high performance. The program is intended to give participants the tools and confidence to manage organizations with full understanding and solid strategy.Participants will experience the Beer Game, a table game, developed by Jay Forrester. Played with pen, paper, printed plastic tablecloths, and poker chips, it simulates the supply chain of the beer industry. In so doing, it illuminates aspects of system dynamics, a signature mode of MIT thought: it illustrates the nonlinear complexities of supply chains and the way individuals are circumscribed by the systems in which they act.You will receive a certificate of course completion at the conclusion of this course.

            "desc": "This senior leadership course helps executives and managers understand how continuous improvement strategies, sustained over a long period of time, affect core business metrics and business development strategy and contribute to the success of the organization. As a participant in this course, you\u2019ll gain a fundamental understanding of how visual management\u2014specifically Dynamic Work Design\u2014can help you find and fix issues in workflow, make improvements in real time, and create competitive advantage. Bring a current \u201cheadache\u201d you\u2019re facing in your organization to workshop and receive personalized feedback on an action plan you can implement immediately.Built on a foundation of highly adaptable principles and methods called Dynamic Work Design, this senior leadership course provides practical tools and methods for sustainable improvement efforts of any scale, in any industry, and in any function. This method leverages and builds on familiar process improvement techniques with which you may be familiar, including Lean Six Sigma, Agile, PDCA cycles, Kanban, and others, adapting and applying them to knowledge work and smart work design.Proceeding from principles, not practices, is a key to sustainable change, allowing integration with current culture and processes while delivering fast results with little overhead, training, or major initiatives. The method has proven to work in businesses as diverse as oil/gas, DNA sequencing, and engineering/innovation and works at the scale of discrete problems or organizational-wide strategic efforts. Improvement begins to happen in rapid and natural ways; results begin showing up almost immediately.Dynamic Work Design was co-created by Nelson Repenning and Don Keiffer after a combined 20+ years of integrated industry practice and academic investigation, and further refined with insights and expertise provided by Sheila Dodge. You will learn how to implement this technique in your own organization directly from two of its creators. You will discover how the process of visual management can help you identify the value-added elements of your own work and that of your organization. You will be able to identify opportunities for improving and get started based on a framework of principles and methods.You will leave this senior leadership course with practical real-world examples and an action plan that focuses on one simple (yet impactful) problem to solve over twelve months (versus the mistake many make of trying to solve twelve problems in one month). Ultimately this will set the foundation for making additional incremental (and feasible) operational improvements and savings within your organization.You will receive a certificate of course completion at the conclusion of this course. You may also be interested in our Executive Certificates which are designed around a central themed track and consist of several courses.

            "desc": "Digitization is revolutionizing marketing strategy. From tablets and big data to new customer monitoring tools and the global emergence of social networking, recent technology has revolutionized the modes of communication through which businesses and brands engage with consumers. Digital marketing and social media marketing courses from MIT are designed to help executives understand the new rules of marketing in the digital age, covering a range of topics that include search marketing, social network marketing and analytics, predictive modeling, mobile advertising and commerce, CRM strategy, and digital advertising.New digital technologies have fundamentally reshaped marketing theory and practice the last decade alone. Technology has changed the modes of communication through which firms engage with consumers. Moore's law has made the storage and analysis of consumer data scalable, creating opportunities for fine-grained behavioral analytics. New monitoring tools have fostered precise and personalized customer relationship management practices. The rise of mobile phones and tablets has enabled location based messaging and reciprocal communication. The ubiquity of video content has promulgated rich, native advertising programs. The global emergence of social networking has enabled networked based predictive modeling and new forms of targeting and referral strategies based on the preferences of consumers' peers. And finally, new social media have brought all of this onto the public stage, with word-of-mouth conversations driving brand awareness and brand loyalty, and user-generated content on review and ratings sites making or breaking demand for products or services.This two-day course provides a detailed, applied perspective on the theory and practice of digital marketing and social media analytics in the 21st century. We will cover concepts such as the difference between earned and paid media, predictive modeling for ad targeting and customer relationship management, measuring and managing product virality, viral product design, native advertising, and engaging the multichannel experience. Throughout the course we will specifically stress the theory and practice of randomized experimentation, AB testing and the importance of causal inference for marketing strategy.Topics covered in this digital marketing program include:",

            "desc": "Recent research indicates that most families that achieve financial success\u2014typically through a family company\u2014lose their success within three generations. Why do some family enterprises derail while others prosper? This new program for multigenerational families will help you understand and implement the important driving factors of long-term, enduring, family enterprise success. The course also examines where family enterprises are going and what will drive their success in the future economy.Please note: The course price of $40,000 is for a team of four (no individual participants). It's $7,500 for each additional person beyond the 4-person team.The Future Family Enterprise program leads multigenerational families through a stimulating week-long conversation that produces clarity on the path ahead for each participating family and its enterprise. Your family will learn practical concepts and tested practices\u2014organized around examples of multigenerational success and failure\u2014to aid your thinking, improve your long-term planning and alignment, and shape the roadmap of your family enterprise system.In this six-day program (Sunday afternoon to Friday at noon), faculty explore the opportunities, challenges, and future trends for owning, governing, and managing a family company and a broader family enterprise organization over multiple generations. Conversations and class sessions focus on the distinct issues faced by multigenerational families that have survived beyond the founder-stage. The program views the family enterprise through the lens of ownership, helping you to understand the important decisions that are yours to make as well as how to govern and plan for the longevity of your family\u2019s enterprise activities.In addition to interactive classroom work and exchanges among families from around the world, your family will have daily, private, facilitated discussions with an experienced family enterprise advisor to focus on your interests and agenda. Families should attend in teams spanning two or more generations. Each family team will leave the program with a tailored action plan built together over the course.Important questions addressed include:The combined experience of faculty and participants produces deep understandings and even profound transformations for participating families. Your family will have conversations you never anticipated and will leave the program feeling closer and more aligned about your future as a result.The Future Family Enterprise program is led by MIT Sloan Senior Lecturer John Davis, a pioneer in the family enterprise field and a globally recognized authority on family enterprise, family wealth, and the family office. Davis joined MIT Sloan after leading the family enterprise area at Harvard Business School for more than 20 years. He is an award-winning teacher and researcher and is the creator of some of the field\u2019s most impactful conceptual frameworks. Davis is also Chairman of Cambridge Family Enterprise Group, a global advisory and research organization.See our on campus Covid-19 policy.THE MIT EDGE\nWorking at the intersection of management and technology, MIT Sloan is uniquely positioned to support family enterprises by:The program is specifically designed for family businesses that have moved beyond the founder stage to the second or third generation of ownership control, or later. It offers a rare opportunity to learn and exchange views with peers from around the globe who understand the complexities of family enterprise systems in later generations and share similar challenges and goals.True to MIT\u2019s Mens et Manus (mind and hand) learning philosophy, we use a variety of teaching methods to apply the learnings to real work in real time. Through interactive classroom modules, case discussions, exercises, small group work across families and facilitated private family coaching sessions, families are provided opportunities for transformative conversations, problem solving, roadmap building, and aligning on your key goals.Participation in this program provides a connection to a dynamic and vibrant MIT community. The MIT campus and surrounding Kendall Square is one of the densest startup and innovation clusters in the world, providing the opportunity to experience an unparalleled entrepreneurial ecosystem.You will receive a certificate of course completion at the conclusion of this course.

        "who_attend_desc": "The Future Family Enterprise program is a transformative experience for families that have moved beyond the founder stage to one where siblings or cousins own the family company (or the investments of the family). Some families may have sold their family company and now manage other assets.This program is designed for family teams generally of four or more individuals. No single participants are admitted. Family teams allow participants to have crucial conversations together and collaborate on the long-term planning required at their stage. It also allows each team to take back to their family enterprise systems more of the concepts, practices, and understandings absorbed during the program. The greatest regret we hear from participants is that they wish they had brought more family members to partake in this unique experience together.Participating families come from many countries and are involved in many industries. They typically have complex family enterprise systems: companies, financial assets and perhaps a family office, family philanthropic and community activities, plus a growing and increasingly complex family and ownership group. Each family in this program has achieved admirable success after the founder-generation and aims to continue their high performance as a family for another generation or more.Participants include family members in and out of the family company or family office; owners and non-owners; board members; family council and owner council members; senior and next generation members; and lineal descendants and spouses. Teams can also include senior non-family executives or board members attending with family members. If you want to discuss the right composition for your family team, we are ready to help.",

            "desc": "The Founder to Family program helps founders, or first generation families-in-business, build a bridge to the next generation. Founders and their family members learn to position their companies and families for ongoing success amid a fast-changing business landscape and increasing family complexity. Structure the planning of your transition to the second generation\u2014no matter how distant or close that transition may be. Keep your family business on a path that builds upon the founder\u2019s groundwork and grows value for another generation or more. Accelerate crucial conversations among the founder and his/her family members to resolve issues and set plans for sustaining family and business success.Please note: The course price of $36,000 is for a team of four (no individual participants). It's $7,000 for each additional person beyond the 4-person team.Family-owned companies, on average, outperform non-family companies, and those at the founder stage are the best performing among them. There are many competitive advantages and good qualities of first generation family companies that should be continued. At the same time, most founder-stage family companies unfortunately don\u2019t succeed into the second generation. But a family can beat these odds, regenerate their success over generations, and flourish. Companies and families need to evolve to stay relevant and guard against vulnerabilities that can be crippling.To propel a successful first generation company into the next generation, founders and their families need to develop and successfully blend the next generation into the governance, ownership, management, wealth-building, succession planning, and other important activities of the family. They must foster talent in the management and ownership groups, build good governance of the company, owners and family, and grow assets for future activities.This 5-day program helps your family learn how to revitalize your success in business and how to integrate the second generation into the plan. It explores the critical elements of managing and owning a high-performance family business, and preparing for the family\u2019s first generational transition\u2014no matter how distant that transition may be. Daily classes with experts explore the complexities of family businesses and the disruptive forces acting on businesses today; family ownership and how to structure and pass it effectively; how to keep the family united and contributing to its enterprise; and how the founder and next generation can partner effectively. Classes stimulate new thinking and promote engaging discussions about the issues family companies at the founder stage face. In addition, every day each family has a private discussion led by an experienced coach to address the topics on their particular agenda which help a family become clear about its goals, capabilities, challenges, and options. By the end of the program each family leaves with an action plan that they can implement going forward.TRANSITIONAL CHALLENGES\nSuccessful founder-stage businesses are enviable powerhouses in many ways\u2014innovation, growth, and returns on assets to name a few. Much of the company\u2019s success\u2014at least for a while\u2014is due to the strengths of the founder and the organization of the company around him or her. But overreliance on the founder makes growing beyond the founder and transitioning the company to the next generation of the family very challenging. Extending success beyond the founder stage typically requires:Added to these traditional requirements are factors that now dramatically affect the success of first-to-second generation transitions: new and often disruptive forces acting on industries and businesses; new generational attitudes about careers and lifestyles; advancements in human longevity; new sources of investment capital; and more plentiful buyers for a family\u2019s successful business. These present both challenges and opportunities for future family and business success.Much needs to eventually change in generational transitions: the leadership team in the company and how decisions are made, the governance system, eventually the ownership group of the business, even family relationships tend to change some as the next generation assumes responsibilities and authority. Understandably, with roles and relationships shifting, these first-to-second generation transitions are often complicated and emotionally sensitive experiences.\nNeedless to say, to beat the odds against survival and continued success requires a disciplined game plan.PROGRAM EXPERIENCE:\nFounder to Family: Sustaining Family Business Success provides a supportive and empowering educational and family workshop experience to address the most important interests and issues that families have at the founder stage.

Participants will also explore the many companies, labs and centers that make MIT and surrounding Kendall Square the epicenter of innovation worldwide.AMP 2022 application deadlines can be found below. Qualified candidates are admitted on a rolling, space-available basis, and space is limited. Early application is encouraged and will increase your chances of being accepted. See our on campus Covid-19 policies.Due to limited class size and the need to reserve hotel rooms, AMP requires a $10,000 deposit within 30 days of acceptance.Are you an experienced executive at an inflection point in your career? Perhaps you\u2019re preparing to move into a C-suite role, or thinking of embarking on an entrepreneurial venture. Are you looking to broaden your global perspective by exchanging success stories (and failures) with peer executives and entrepreneurs from around the world? Are you a progressive leader who is ready to be challenged and to challenge others? Are you ready to grow your network and forge deep, lasting relationships you never thought possible in five short weeks?

Limited to a maximum of 35 participants, the program is intentionally diverse, representative of global points of view. Executives in the program may or may not have an advanced degree but all have rich work experience, including P&L responsibility and significant international experience. In line with the MIT Sloan mission, all participants have the ambition and desire to advance management practice and make a broader impact in their organizations and the world.AMP is delivered as an integrated combination of:During the five weeks, participants benefit from:AMP participants arrive with sky-high expectations for world-class learning and leading-edge research on a wide range of topics.

            "desc": "This systems thinking course provides an intensive, hands-on introduction to system dynamics, a unique framework for understanding and managing complex businesses and organizations. Participants are introduced to a variety of problem solving tools, including mapping techniques, simulation models, and MIT\u2019s \u201cmanagement flight simulators\u201d to help them understand the sources of persistent problems and how business decisions may result in complicated cause-and-effect loops.Please note: Course runs over six days: June 7-10, June 14-15. See schedule tab for additional details.In a world of growing complexity, many of the most vexing problems facing managers arise from the unanticipated side-effects of their own past actions. In response, organizations struggle to increase the speed of learning and adopt a more systemic approach. The challenge is to move beyond outdated slogans about accelerated learning and \u201cthinking systemically\u201d to implementing practical tools that help managers design better operating policies, understand complexity, and guide effective change.This program introduces participants to system dynamics, a powerful framework for identifying, designing, and implementing high-leverage interventions for sustained success in complex systems. It has been used successfully in diverse industries and organizations, such as Airbus, Compaq, General Motors, Hewlett-Packard, Intel, and Merck. Developed at MIT more than fifty years ago by computer pioneer Jay Forrester, system dynamics led to the creation of management flight simulators that allow managers to accelerate learning, experience the long-term side effects of decisions, and design structures and strategies for greater success.Through intensive, hands-on workshops and interactive experiments, participants will be exposed to the principles of systems thinking and practical methods for putting them into action. They will be introduced to a variety of tools, including mapping techniques, simulation models, and MIT\u2019s management flight simulators\u2014such as the Beer Game \u2014 which they can apply to their own business environment as soon as they complete the program. Throughout the week, participants work in small groups and interact closely with the course leaders, Professors Sterman and Repenning.THE BEER GAME\n\u201cThere is no actual beer in the Beer Game,\u201d says John Sterman.Rather, the Beer Game is a table game, developed in the late 1950s by digital computing pioneer and Sloan professor Jay Forrester, SM \u201945. Played with pen, paper, printed plastic tablecloths, and poker chips, it simulates the supply chain of the beer industry. In so doing, it illuminates aspects of system dynamics, a signature mode of MIT thought: it illustrates the nonlinear complexities of supply chains and the way individuals are circumscribed by the systems in which they act.\u201cIn my view, the real purpose and real value of a Sloan education is to develop [students\u2019] capabilities as systems thinkers and the leadership abilities to use those capabilities to build the world we truly want. Not for the short run. Not to boost the bottom line, or to pump up the stock price. But to create the world we truly want, for the long run.\u201dYou will receive a certificate of course completion at the conclusion of this course.

Executives are right to be concerned. At least two-thirds of large organizations struggle to implement their strategies. This course is designed to help global executives close the gap between strategic intent and results by introducing a systematic framework and hands-on tools to drive execution in their own organizations.Most leaders rely on a set of implicit beliefs about how to get things done when they try to execute their strategy. Many common assumptions about execution, however, are incomplete at best and dangerous at worst. Despite its importance, execution remains poorly understood\u2014for every ten books on how to formulate a strategy there is only one on how to translate it into effective action. Executives often focus on specific tools, such as the balanced scorecard or management by objectives, to manage risk and drive strategy execution without understanding how these tools interact with one another.Led by Dr. Donald Sull, a global expert on strategy execution in complex organizations, this course will help leaders reframe execution so that they can avoid common mistakes and focus on the actions that are most likely to bring results. The course introduces a systemic view of strategy execution based on over a decade of research and field-tested in dozens of corporations around the world.As part of your participation in this program, you and 30 or more of your colleagues will complete a state-of-the-art survey in advance of the course. The data from this survey will be analyzed to provide you with real-time insights that help pinpoint concrete opportunities to improve your organization\u2019s execution capacity.Closing the Gap Between Strategy and Execution is:",

Navigating the transitions sparked by digitally-driven change requires deep awareness\u2014of ourselves and others. This new program leverages leadership assessments and group coaching to provide leaders with insights, tools, and frameworks for navigating the human side of these transitions.Please note: The application deadline for this digital transformation strategy course is 7 days prior to course start.Digitally driven change is upending the way we live and work and posing an increasing number of challenges for business leaders, who must manage a waterfall of decisions around hiring, training, resource allocation, and investments in technologies while continuing to lead their companies to success. Entire teams may be asked to transform their skills and ways of working as a result. How can we help ourselves and others to respond nimbly to change and be better prepared for the next disruption? And what is required to shift successfully from fragility to agility and thrive in this new world of work?Led by Hal Gregersen and Roger Lehman and conducted live online, this innovative new program emphasizes the creative intelligence and soft skills required of leaders when change happens. The course provides a transition toolkit to draw on as well as a structured process for containing, metabolizing, and addressing disruptive transitions, tackling the question, how do we recognize and successfully navigate transitions when change happens?Course faculty also include Vivienne Ming, founder and executive chair at Socos Labs, and Rana el Kaliouby, co-founder and CEO of Affectiva, who will explore in depth the human side of digital transitions.Participants will be asked to complete leadership assessments (for use in a group coaching day) and submit a summary of the key transition challenges they are facing as a result of digital disruption and transformation prior to the start of the program.You will receive a certificate of course completion at the conclusion of this course.

This new business analytics program provides executives the opportunity to step back and engage in the guided strategic thinking necessary to develop, refine, and implement an analytics program for their organization. It taps into the best practices from the sports industry\u2019s analytics revolution as a case study.While the sports industry is an analytics pioneer, data driven decision-making has become essential to business success in nearly every industry. Starting a business analytics program, however, is easier said than done. Taught by sports marketing strategist Ben Shields, this program provides executives insight into the sports industry\u2019s \u201csecret sauce\u201d and helps them apply it immediately to the development of their own business analytics program.The first day of this business analytics program focuses on designing an analytics strategy. Faculty will introduce a strategic framework for developing an analytics program. Executives will learn how sports organizations have applied this framework on both the team personnel and business sides. Day one will conclude with an action-learning exercise to guide students in developing a working draft of their analytics strategy.On the second day, the curriculum will focus on implementation. The success of an analytics program is not only driven by sound strategy but also the ability of an organization (and its executives) to execute through effective leadership and management. Critical topics on day two include making the right technology decisions, building and organizing an analytics team, and communicating data for impact. The day will close with a capstone session on leading an analytics transformation during which participants will share their new analytics vision for their organization.Note: This is not an advanced data science course. This program is designed for executives who are looking for strategic insights and action plans on the management of analytics.",

How can families build an integrated family social impact strategy\u2014driven by shared values, and utilizing the full set of opportunities, talents, and resources available to them?This family business course takes place over four half-days.At the intersection of family enterprise, social impact and systems thinking, this new, interactive course is designed to support families on their journey toward a positive social impact and family legacy in a rapidly changing and disrupted world. We bring together owners and future owners to develop an understanding of their dynamic family systems and work with them to create an integrated impact strategy. We then connect families with MIT faculty members to dive deeper into building knowledge and exploring opportunities in support of their specific strategies. Families will leave the course with a better understanding of how to strengthen family unity, talent, culture, and reputation while uniquely contributing to a better world.By mid-century, $41 trillion of family wealth will be inherited by the next generation, 60% of whom consider it important to use their family\u2019s wealth to make a positive social or environmental impact. Senior generations want to create a positive legacy, which includes family unity, talent development, economic success, and reputation. The events of 2020 have motivated purpose-driven families to intensify their commitment to the health of our society and world, building on their unique position in society - harnessing their collective power toward meaningful action. It is not always clear, however, what the appropriate impact focus should be, amid competing priorities.Owning Impact provides families with an opportunity to convene around this charge, and to build family alignment on the topics of impact investing, philanthropy, corporate social responsibility, and political engagement. Through content, case studies, structured breakout activities, and meaningful discussions, participants will learn how to navigate the tensions of family social impact - moving from fragmented activities by individual family members toward a cohesive family social impact strategy, animated by shared values and drawing on the full capability of the family. Through the lens of systems thinking, a signature mode of thought at MIT, families will also learn how to deploy effort and resources in ways that truly advance their goals and minimize unintended consequences.The course is taught by Jason Jay, director of MIT Sloan\u2019s Sustainability Initiative, and John Davis, lead faculty member of Family Enterprise Executive Programs at MIT Sloan. Jay and Davis are collaborating to develop a portfolio of offerings\u2014the Owning Impact Project\u2014to guide families as they strive to create positive social impact and family legacy.The MIT PerspectiveMIT is uniquely positioned to provide support to families on their journey:Learn more about the live online experience.\u201cI have personally gained some important insights from telling our family\u2019s story and applying the systems tools that Jason and John have developed. I hope that others in our network are able to gain some value from this MIT approach as well.\u201d  - Sam Bonsey\u201cIt\u2019s great fun to work with Jason and John to explore these dynamics and help other families along the journey,\u201d he says. \u201cI think MIT could do something unique and necessary in this space.\u201d - Temple Fennell",

Family teams allow participants to have crucial conversations together and collaborate on short and long-term planning during the program. It also allows each team to take back to their family enterprise systems the concepts, practices, and understandings absorbed during the course. Our family programs draw participants from around the world. They typically have complex family enterprise systems: companies, financial assets and perhaps a family office, family philanthropic and community activities, plus a growing and increasingly complex family and ownership group. They may have experimented with impact investing, philanthropy, and structured corporate sustainability efforts but seek greater impact and coherence across these activities.",
